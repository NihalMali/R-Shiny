# Election Dataset Analysis Shiny App

## Introduction
This Shiny app provides an interactive analysis of an election dataset. Users can explore various aspects of the dataset using different tabs for summary, visualizations, and interactive plots.

## Summary Tab
The "Summary" tab displays a summary table of the election dataset.

## Visualization Tab
The "Visualization" tab includes a bar plot showing election votes by year and candidate.

## Interactive Bar Chart Tab
The "Interactive Bar Chart" tab features an interactive bar chart where users can explore election votes by year and candidate.

## Interactive Scatter Plot Tab
The "Interactive Scatter Plot" tab displays an interactive scatter plot for exploring election votes by year and candidate.

## Data Source
The election dataset is loaded from a CSV file named "election.csv." Make sure to replace this with the actual path or URL to your dataset.

## App Code
```R
library(shiny)
library(plotly)  # For interactive plots

# Sample election dataset (replace this with your actual dataset)
election_data <- read.csv("electin.csv")
# Define UI for the application
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Election Dataset Analysis"),
  
  # Tabs for different visualizations and insights
  tabsetPanel(
    tabPanel("Introduction", 
             h2("Welcome to the Election Dataset Analysis App!"),
             p("This web application provides insights into the election dataset. You can explore various aspects of the dataset using the navigation tabs."),
             p("To get started, select a specific analysis from the menu.")
    ),
    
    tabPanel("Summary", 
             tableOutput("summaryTable")
    ),
    tabPanel("Visualization", 
             plotOutput("electionPlot")
    ),
    
    tabPanel("Interactive Bar Chart", 
             plotlyOutput("interactiveBarChart")
    ),
    
    tabPanel("Interactive Scatter Plot", 
             plotlyOutput("interactiveScatterPlot")
    )
  )
)

           x = "Year", y = "Votes",
           fill = "Candidate")
  })
  
  
  # Interactive bar chart output
  output$interactiveBarChart <- renderPlotly({
    plot_ly(election_data, x = ~Year, y = ~Votes, color = ~Candidate, type = "bar") %>%
      layout(title = "Interactive Bar Chart: Election Votes by Year and Candidate",
             xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
             yaxis = list(title = "Votes"),
             showlegend = TRUE)
  })
  
  # Interactive scatter plot output

    plot_ly(election_data, x = ~Year, y = ~Votes, color = ~Candidate, type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
      layout(title = "Interactive Scatter Plot: Election Votes by Year and Candidate",
             xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
             yaxis = list(title = "Votes"),
             showlegend = TRUE)
  })
